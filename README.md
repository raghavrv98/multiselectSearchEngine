Application Overview
--------------------

The application is created on the basis of the requirement that is mentioned in the project. I have implemented all the necessary features for a smooth experience for the user.

Steps are already on the home page including how to search via the multi-select input field. I am also mentioning it here for a better understanding.

Steps to search    
1. Please Search anything as Cat, Dog..etc in the search box    
2. Then Select an Option    
3. Click the search button for search results

There is a separate component named Multiselect that is used on the homepage. Also implemented a feature for the component's end user to enable caching.

Implemented the cache handler by myself and not using any third-party library to experience the hustle of making it.

Implementing HTML and CSS for making the multi-select box and search button and all the things on my own to make sure that I have skills to make things from scratch and implemented them.

While searching anything on input fields, and after selecting the desired multiple options, the multiple options are added to the input field, and at last hit the search button for showing the results corresponding to it.

After searching the result, the resulting data is shown as a payload in a box down to the search box titled "Search Results:". 

We can show data in a table or any card form. But due to less time not able to do it.

Hope I am clear enough to make you understand the feature that I worked upon.
Thanks for considering my profile. 
Looking forward to working with you.
